# Craigslist NYC Apartment Scraper

## Description
This project is a web scraper built in Python that extracts apartment listings data from Craigslist's New York City section. The scraper collects information such as the title, price, neighborhood, and URL of apartment listings, and saves it into a CSV file for further analysis.

### Purpose
The purpose of this scraper is to automate the collection of rental data in NYC, allowing users to analyze rental trends, compare prices across different neighborhoods, and identify affordable housing options. This data can be beneficial for potential renters, real estate researchers, and data enthusiasts interested in the NYC rental market.

## Website Used
- **Website**: [Craigslist NYC Apartments](https://newyork.craigslist.org/search/apa#search=1~list~0~0)
- **Reason for Choosing**: Craigslist is one of the most popular platforms for housing listings in the United States. It provides a vast amount of user-generated data on rentals across various neighborhoods, making it an ideal source for gathering real-time rental information. Personally I used it for searching apartments.
